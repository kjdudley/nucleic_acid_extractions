+ Extract RNA from Helicoverpa diapause 2 pupal heads
+ Extract DNA from Helicoverpa diapause 2 pupal heads

**Detailed Procedures and Results**

This extraction is for diapause batch 2, organisms 1 through 8. Coded D2R(1-8) and D2D(1-8) following all other extractions in this procedure. RNA extraction is using the PureLink RNA extraction kit. DNA extraction is using Victoria's nominated protocol.  

*Setup*

1. Book RNA hood space prior to date.

2. Autoclave mortar and pestles (8), tweezers, scalpel blade and empty petri dish - Previously done.

3. Bake M&P's at 80+ degrees - Previously done.

4. Ensure enough liquid nitrogen is present in the laboratory to carry out 8 extractions.

5. Turn on heating block to 70 degrees, ensuring WIP card is placed on it.

5. Wipe down RNA hood, rack to be used, every mortar and pestle, pipette tip boxes (fresh), scalpel handle and blade packet, and any other item to be placed in the hood with RNAse ZAP.

6. Take 6mL Lysis Buffer and place in a fresh falcon tube on ice. Take ice box over to the chemical hood, along with p200 tips. Take 2-mercaptoethanol from the storage locker, and pipette 60μL into the lysis buffer falcon tube. Place back in ice and transport back to RNA hood. 

7. Take 100% ethanol from storage locker and make fresh 70% ethanol with RNAse-free water (7mL EtOH + 3mL H20). Place in ice bucket in RNA hood. 

8. Set up 32 tubes, in 4 rows of 8. Label 1 set D2(1-8) body. Label 1 set D2D(1-8). Label the last 2 sets 1-8 as they are thrown away during RNA protocol. 

9. Fill flask with enough liquid nitrogen to ensure 8 extractions are completed comfortably.

10. Fill DNA tubes with 0.25mL DNA lysis buffer ( 0.1M Tris-Hcl ph 9, 0.1M EDTA pH 8, 1% (w/v) SDS ) and place on ice.

11. Take samples out of -80 freezer and into ice box. This marks the start of the protocol.

*RNA extraction*

1. Remove one pupae from the tube, place in the cold petri dish and slice off the head section (marked by a line in the shell). Place the body into a corresponding tube, noting the number. Place the head section into a mortar and pestle filled with liquid nitrogen and begin crushing.

2. Once crushed, remove some powder and place in DNA tube matching the correct number as per the body sample. Pipette mix, then place this tube on ice.
 
3. With the remaining sample, pipette 0.6mL RNA lysis buffer into the mortar and pestle, mixing and pipetting into the corresponding tube. Once sufficient material has been collected, place on ice and continue for remaining 7 samples, changing mortar and pestle with every sample. 

4. Centrifuge all samples at 12000 xg for 2 minutes. Pipette lysate into the new numbered tube, and add 0.6mL cold 70% EtOH. Vortex for 3 seconds, then add 700μL to the RNA column. Repeat for all samples.

5. Centrigure at 12,000 xg, 15 seconds, RT. Discard the flow through, then add remaining lysate + EtOH mix to column, repeating the spin.

6. Add 700μL Wash Buffer I to the column, centrifuge 12,000 x g, 15 seconds, RT. Discard the entire collection tube and replace with a new one. 

7. Add 500μL Wash Buffer II to the column, centrifuge 12,000 x g, 15 seconds, RT. Discard the flow-through.

8. Add 500μL Wash Buffer II to the column, centrifuge 12,000 x g, 15 seconds, RT. Discard the flow-through.

9. Centrifuge spin columns at 12,000 x g for 1 minute at RT to dry the membrane. 

10. Prepare collection tubes, place columns into the tubes and add 30μL RNase-free Water. Leave to incubate for 1 minute, then centrifuge for 2 miutes, 12,000 x g at RT. Label the tubes corresponding to their code and store on ice for result reading. Once nanodropped, store in -80 freezer.

*DNA extractions* 

Once RNA extractions are complete, move onto DNA extraction steps. Due to use of RNAse I do not start this procedure until RNA work is complete.

1. Thaw 2 aliquots of RNase on ice. 

2. Pipette 10μL RNase into each DNA sample tube, flick mix and place in 70 degree heating block for 30 minutes. 

3. After 30 minute incubation, add 35μL 8M Sodium Acetate, mix by inversion and incubate on ice for 30 minutes. 

4. Spin for 5 minutes at 13,000 RPM, RT.

5. Take the acqueous layer and mix with 300μL Phenol:Chloroform in a new, numbered tube. Vortex for 3 seconds then spin for 5 minutes at 13,000 RPM, RT.

6. Remove the acqueous layer and place into another new, numbered tube. Repeat step 5, placing the acqueous layer into another tube, this time labelling it with D2D(1-8).

7. Mix this supernatant with 150μL Isopropanol, and spin for 5 minutes at 13,000RPM. Theoretically a DNA pellet should be visible. 

8. Wash this pellet with 70% ethanol, and spin down for 5 minutes at 13,000RPM. Repeat this step to ensure clean DNA is collected. 

9. Air dry on the bench for 5-10 minutes until pellet is visibly dry. Resuspend in 30μL nuclease-free H2O and store on ice until results are read.
