**Overview**

+ To assess whether RNase was inhibited during extractions

**Detailed Procedures and Results**

This test will provide diffinitive proof of whether the large amount of 'degradation' is DNA or RNA. After searching through hours of researchgate many people have the same profile which turns out to be RNA so I am proceeding with another round of RNAse and running the sample straight on a gel (RNase has no downstream interference with DNA applications). 

*Setup*

1. Heat a heating block to 45 degrees.

2. Set 0.8% Agarose gel.

3. Take aliquot of known "contaminated" DNA sample (for this tets we will use C3D5) - 10uL test from a 30uL volume. 

4. Add 2uL RNase A stock. 

5. Incubate 15 minutes in 45 degree heating block. 

6. Run produce on prepared gel for 2 hours, 60V.

Results: A clear result is shown by the RNAse treatment - The low molecular weight contamination has disappeared in the DNA sample, and within 15 minutes it is very obvious the entire TR3 sample has been digested. This not only suggests that the RNase stock is still functioning correctly, but that the activity of it must be inhibited by something within the lysis buffer - something which did not occur using the QIAGEN preps, Trizol extractions or the CTAB buffers. The positive side is that a simple 15 minute RNase treatment to all DNA samples is the only thing required to get the DNA suitable for isorad procedures.
