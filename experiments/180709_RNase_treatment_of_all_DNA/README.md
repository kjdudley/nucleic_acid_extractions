**Overview**

+ To remove DNA contamination in all samples

**Detailed Procedures and Results**

This procedure will clean-up all DNA samples and allow them to be ready for Isorad and LCMS procedures in the future. 

*Setup*

1. Heat a heating block to 45 degrees.

2. Set 0.8% Agarose gel.

4. Add 2uL RNase A stock to thawed DNA sample 

5. Incubate 15 minutes in 45 degree heating block. 

6. Run sample on prepared gel for 2 hours, 60V.

Suggested action:

Assess how many stored diapause and control pupae are left - use straight DNA extraction method as performed prior to splitting samples for RNA and DNA. Perhaps tissue amount was not appropriate for large amounts of DNA to be extracted when split into two works (30mg was used in dissociation), or the different salt caused a lack of DNA precipitation. The diapause samples still have enough that they can be trialled for isorad once the technique is working, however control samples will need re-extracting.
