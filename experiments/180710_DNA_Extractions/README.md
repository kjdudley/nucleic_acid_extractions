+ Extract DNA from Helicoverpa tissue for pooling using known, working protocol

*DNA extractions* 

1. Autoclave micropestle tubes, potassium acetate and lysis buffer.

2. Slice tissue into sections and place in cold 250uL Lysis buffer.

3. Mash with micropestle until homogenized.

4. Incubate for 30 minutes at 70C.

5. Add 35uL Potassium Acetate (pH 9), inversion mix and incubate on ice for 30 minutes. 

4. Spin for 5 minutes at 13,000 RPM, RT.

5. Take the acqueous layer and mix with 300μL Phenol:Chloroform in a new, numbered tube. Vortex for 3 seconds then spin for 5 minutes at 13,000 RPM, RT.

6. Remove the acqueous layer and place into another new, numbered tube. Repeat step 5, placing the acqueous layer into another tube.

7. Mix this supernatant with 150μL Isopropanol, and spin for 5 minutes at 13,000RPM. Theoretically a DNA pellet should be visible. 

8. Wash this pellet with 70% ethanol, and spin down for 5 minutes at 13,000RPM. Repeat this step to ensure clean DNA is collected. 

9. Air dry on the bench for 5-10 minutes until pellet is visibly dry. Resuspend in 30μL nuclease-free H2O and store on ice until results are read.

Obvious lipid carryover (pupae body tisue used).

Action: Pool all samples together (800uL), clean extractions with secondary phenol:chloroform reaction alongside new extractions.
