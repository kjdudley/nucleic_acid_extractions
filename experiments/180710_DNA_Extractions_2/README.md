+ Extract DNA from Helicoverpa diapause heads for LCMS protocol using known, working protocol

**Detailed Procedures and Results**

This extraction is for Diapause Helicoverpa organisms that were collected with the RNA extraction pupae. DNA extraction is using Victoria's nominated protocol, using Potassium Acetate as intended instead of the Sodium Acetate replacement.  

*DNA extractions* 

1. Autoclave micropestle tubes, potassium acetate and lysis buffer.

2. Slice head off pupae and place in cold 250uL Lysis buffer.

3. Mash with micropestle until homogenized.

4. Incubate for 30 minutes at 70C.

5. Add 35uL Potassium Acetate (pH 9), inversion mix and incubate on ice for 30 minutes. 

4. Spin for 5 minutes at 13,000 RPM, RT.

5. Take the acqueous layer and mix with 300μL Phenol:Chloroform in a new, numbered tube. Vortex for 3 seconds then spin for 5 minutes at 13,000 RPM, RT.

6. Remove the acqueous layer and place into another new, numbered tube. Repeat step 5, placing the acqueous layer into another tube, this time labelling it with C3D(1-8).

7. Mix this supernatant with 150μL Isopropanol, and spin for 5 minutes at 13,000RPM. Theoretically a DNA pellet should be visible. 

8. Wash this pellet with 70% ethanol, and spin down for 5 minutes at 13,000RPM. Repeat this step to ensure clean DNA is collected. 

9. Air dry on the bench for 5-10 minutes until pellet is visibly dry. Resuspend in 30μL nuclease-free H2O and store on ice until results are read.
